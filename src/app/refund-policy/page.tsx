      <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
      <p>
        Once a project has started or services have been delivered, we generally
        cannot offer refunds. However, if a billing or service issue arises, we
        will review it on a case-by-case basis.
      </p>

      <h2>Project Cancellation</h2>
      <p>
        Clients may request cancellation before the project kickoff. Refunds (if
        applicable) will exclude administrative or consultation fees.
      </p>
